# This file specifies the defaults that repos will utilize.
#
# The defaults are organized by distribution name and within each distribution
# are specified hosts to query and initial paths on said hosts where the
# discovery of available repos begins.
#
# Fedora specifies an archive host as older distributions are moved there.
# Repository discovery will recognize this based on the residual file left in
# the release area indicating the distribution has been moved and not by
# querying the archive host directlyZ  The net effect of this is that Fedora
# requires a release host in order to discover any repository even those
# that have been archived.
#
# The paths are interpreted as follows:
#     released: released distribution
#     latest:   on the path to being released
#     nightly:  the most recently generated distribution
#
# In discovering repositories if there is no nightly path specified
# the latest path will be used.  If there is no latest path specified the
# released path will be used.  If there is no released path specified no
# release repositories will be discovered.
#
# To support the tooling which consumes the result of repository discovery
# the returned results are aggregated using set semantics in the following
# manner:
#     released: nightly << latest << released
#     latest:   nightly << released << latest
#     nightly:  released << latest << nightly
#
# The result of this aggregation is that each set contains the discovered
# repositories that most closely match the above described path interpretations.
