# This file specifies the defaults that repos will utilize.
#
# The defaults are organized by distribution name and within each distribution
# are specified hosts to query and initial paths on said hosts where the
# discovery of available repos begins.
#
# Fedora specifies an archive host as older distributions are moved there.
# Repository discovery will recognize this based on the residual file left in
# the release area indicating the distribution has been moved and not by
# querying the archive host directlyZ  The net effect of this is that Fedora
# requires a release host in order to discover any repository even those
# that have been archived.
#
# The paths are interpreted as follows:
#     released: released distribution
#     latest:   on the path to being released
#     nightly:  the most recently generated distribution
#
# In discovering repositories if there is no nightly path specified
# the latest path will be used.  If there is no latest path specified the
# released path will be used.  If there is no released path specified no
# release repositories will be discovered.
#
# To support the tooling which consumes the result of repository discovery
# the returned results are aggregated using set semantics in the following
# manner:
#     released: nightly << latest << released
#     latest:   nightly << released << latest
#     nightly:  released << latest << nightly
#
# The result of this aggregation is that each set contains the discovered
# repositories that most closely match the above described path interpretations.
defaults:
  # Repos are discovered dynamically and can be a relatively lengthy process.
  # Rather than perform discovery every time repos is used it caches the
  # discovered repos to speed up subsequent uses.  The following defaults allow
  # customization of the cache.
  cache:
    directories:
      # The path to the directory in which to cache the repo info.
      # Must specify a full-path; use of ~ for user's home is supported.
      # DEFAULT: $HOME.
      root:
      # The sub-directory of root to use for the cache.
      # DEFAULT:.python-repos-cache
      subdirectory:

    # How frequently to refresh the cache.
    # Format is <days>-<hours>-<minutes>
    # Each field is an arbitrary integer; e.g., one day could be specified
    # as 24 hours.
    # Fields are interpreted right-to-left.  That is...
    #  a single number is interpreted as minutes
    #  h-m is interpreted as h hours and m minutes
    #  d-h-m is interpreted as d days, h hours and m minutes
    # DEFAULT: one day; i.e., 1-0-0
    # A minimum of 1 minute is imposed.
